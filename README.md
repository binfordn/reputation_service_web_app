# reputation_service_web_app
A basic web app that sends artifacts (e.g. URLs, IPs, file hashes) to a reputation service and gets categories (e.g. Safe, Malicious, Social Media, Education) that the service knows about them.

This type of service requires an API key, as well as a session ID generated at runtime, for authentication.

The code is pretty spaghetti-y and should probably not be used by anyone. I created it just to get a feel for how to make a web app that uses an API.
